## Kubernetes tasks

### Minikube

* Start a local Kubernetes cluster
```bash
minikube start
```

* Stop the local Kubernetes cluster
```bash
minikube stop

* manually import image into local cluster (by default, minikube uses the Docker Hub registry to pull images, and it doesnâ€™t have access to your local ones. Therefore, it will not find the image you built for the Catalog Service application)
```bash
minikube image load catalog-service:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
```
